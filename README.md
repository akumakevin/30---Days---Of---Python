# 📘 30 Days of Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python** project!- College Level 

This repository contains my personal learning journey as I study and practice Python programming for 30 days. Inspired by *Asabeneh Yetayeh’s 30 Days of Python*, this notebook consolidates all my daily exercises, notes, and solutions into one structured file.



## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim of this challenge is to:

* Build a **strong foundation in Python**
* Practice writing clean, readable, and efficient code
* Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Work consistently for 30 days
* Document progress for academic, personal, and portfolio growth



## 🧠 What’s Included

All **30 days** are compiled in a single Jupyter notebook:

### ✔️ Day-by-Day Topics Covered

* **Day 1–3:** Variables, data types, basic operations
* **Day 4–7:** Strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
* **Day 8–10:** Conditionals, loops, functions
* **Day 11–15:** Modules, packages, list comprehension, error handling
* **Day 16–20:** File handling, Python built-ins, regular expressions
* **Day 21–25:** Classes & Objects, OOP principles
* **Day 26–30:** Functional programming, Python packages, modern Python features

Each day contains **examples, explanations, practice exercises, and solutions**.



## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebook, install:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

Then launch:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🚀 How to Use This Notebook

* You can read through each day sequentially
* Run the code cells to practice
* Modify the exercises with your own solutions
* Use it as a reference when building future Python projects



## 🌱 Why I Did This Project

I am committed to strengthening my programming skills and building a strong base in Python for data science, software development, and future academic work. This challenge allowed me to practice consistently and develop confidence in writing code.
